## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot. I began investigating Sass, but I'm not quite ready for it.

The most challenging part was to get the overlay to follow the image, and to try to switch the photos from desktop to mobile. I ultimately failed, but it is time to move on.

### Continued development

I will continue to try to figure out BEM and Sass.
